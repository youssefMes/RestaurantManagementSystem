# RestaurantManagementSystem

## Introduction
>In the following Project, we are going to use reactjs and GraphQL for the developpement of the services and Apache Kafka for the communication between them.

This project is developed to automate day to day activity of a restaurant. Restaurant is a kind of business that serves people all over world with ready made food. This system is developed to provide service facility to restaurant and also to the customer. This restaurant management system can be used by employees in a restaurant to handle the clients, their orders and can help them easily find free tables or place orders. 

The services that are provided are the administartion service, reservation service and the delivery service. The restaurant menu is organized by categories (appetizers, soups, salads, entrees, sides and drinks) of menu items. Main objective build the system this is to provide  online ordering and reservation service to the customer. 

Each menu item has a name, price and associated recipe. A recipe for a menu item has a chef, preparation instruction sand associated ingredients. With this system online, ordering and reservation management will become easier and systematic to replace traditional system where are still using paper. To resister a meal online, the customer has to become a member first then he can access the later part of the site. this project to facilitate customer for make online ordering and reservation. The option of becoming member was only an attempt to avoid (to some extent) placing the fake bookings.

Online RestaurantManagementSystem is the system for manage the restaurant business. After successful login the customer can access the menu page with the items listed according to the desired time. The main point of developing this system is to help restaurant administrator manage the restaurant business and help customer for online ordering and reserve table. In proposed system user can search for a menu according to his choice (according to price range and category of food) and later he can order a meal.

The project is developing because; many restaurants have a lot difficult to manage the business such as customer ordering and reservation table. If the customer book an order and later wants to cancel the order, he is permitted to do this only within a specific time period. By using manual customer ordering is difficult to waiter keep the correct customer information and maybe loss the customer information. The customer is also given with the facility to view the status of the order and if the order is ready then he can go and get it.
